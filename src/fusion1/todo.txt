* setup vision and hearing pipelines

* build age estimation

* build gender estimation

* id, age and gender estimation cannot run asynchronously, so they have to be embedded in vision pipeline somehow

- enqueue the age/gender/ID requests, so we only need one external process/network that we can re-use

- fix realsense input and output

- refactor saliency code

- refactor ambience code

- replacement of joint_state_publisher that publishes motor angles, or, combine into fusion.py, so it accesses the motors directly
