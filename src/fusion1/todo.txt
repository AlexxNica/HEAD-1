* setup vision and hearing pipelines

* build age estimation

* build gender estimation

* id, age and gender estimation cannot run asynchronously, so they have to be embedded in vision pipeline somehow

* create directory structure and store all thumbs

+ enqueue the age/gender/ID requests, so we only need one external process/network that we can re-use

+ make transformations work from motor positions (refactor current perception ROS node)

+ hook up rviz (analyze current perception ROS node)

- make 2D face detection 3D using camera FOV

- adjustable timer periods and FOVs

+ generate 3D coordinates from faces

+ hook up realsense

- cut out realsense thumbs and send them over

+ visualize users with id, age, gender etc. info

- hook up speech and localization

- refactor ambience for all cameras

- refactor saliency for all cameras

- visualize saliency

- fuse observations (needs discussion w/ OpenCog people)

- output opencog (needs discussion w/ OpenCog people)

- output classic ROS

- BUG: sometimes there are 0 faces in the puser list and python dumps an exception, which should not be possible
