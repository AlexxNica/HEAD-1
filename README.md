blender_api_msgs
================

ROS node for [blender_api](https://github.com/hansonrobotics/blender_api)

# Design goals
* Avoids adding ROS code to the blender_api python module
* Eliminates the need for other ROS nodes (such as 
  [robo_blender](https://github.com/hansonrobotics/blender_api)) from having 
  to import the blender_api python module.
  
# Usage
TBD
