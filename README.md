This repository contains the integrated code for controlling and
interacting with many Hanson Robotics robot heads.  It includes the
full performance pipeline and infrastructure:

* Perception, via ROS webcam nodes.
* Face detection, for seeing faces in the room.
* Blender robot model, for gracefully controlling facial expressions.
* Behavior tree, for scripting performaces.
* Motor control ROS nodes, for controlling the physical robot.
